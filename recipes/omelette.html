        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The combination of ground spices, chillies and eggs just works. Lightly crisp around the edges, moist
            eggs and with fiery chilli kick. You can serve this masala omelette with soft white bread and some
            sweet chilli sauce or ketchup. Or sometimes even rolled in hot chapattis. You can stuff it in some 
            toast too. Just increase the chilli heat if you would like a touch more spice.
